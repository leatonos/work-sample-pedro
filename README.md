# About This project
This is a work sample made for riskthinking.AI.

It was pretty fun to develop this, and I learned a lot in the process. I decided to make this short text to thank you for the opportunity and explain that the risk values that appear on the map and in the graph are averages calculated based on the assets that were filtered.

I really hope to have the chance to learn more about your company and the role, and to meet the team.
